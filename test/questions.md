**• How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.** 

    1. I spent a total of about 8 hours on the test.  
    I would improve the design of the project.  
    Plus, I would add "media" to the posts, because now I have not used this field.  
    Would add tags to posts and search for those tags.  
    Add images to posts.

 **• How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?**

    2. I have never done this, but as I understand it, first you need to check the skl queries, how quickly they are executed, how much data they return (if you iterate over this data in a loop, then on large amounts of data it takes a lot of time). Are there multiple queries inside loops (for example, reading model data inside foreach). After that, you need to watch the recursion and the like.
